This document* explores the inner workings and conceptual reasoning behind iffy.app, designed to help users assess the significance of political issues in their lives. The focus here is on the logic of how weights are calculated, the role of AI in reasoning, and how user inputs shape the output, rather than technical implementation details. This explanation is aimed at a technically minded audience with an interest in politics and analysis.

## 1. **Purpose and Philosophical Foundations**

At its core, iffy.app seeks to answer a deeply human question: *How much should I care about this issue?* It provides a framework for prioritizing political topics based on structured, evidence-driven reasoning. The methodology relies on combining:

- **Quantifiable Importance**: Assigning weights (1-10) to aspects of the issue.
- **Qualitative Explanation**: Contextualizing those weights with facts and reasoning.
- **Personal Relevance**: Incorporating user-specific inputs to make the assessment actionable.

The driving principle is to balance objectivity (statistical and policy impact) with subjectivity (user preferences and personal relevance).

## 2. **How Weights Are Determined**

### The Categories
The tool evaluates each topic across predefined categories:

1. **Statistical Impact**:
   - Assesses how broadly the issue affects the population.
   - Anchored in data points like percentages, per capita statistics, or economic metrics.

2. **Policy Impact Potential**:
   - Measures the feasibility of addressing the issue through legislative or regulatory changes.
   - Considers alternative mechanisms (e.g., private sector solutions).

3. **Social Relevance**:
   - Focuses on cultural and societal dimensions, such as correcting imbalances or addressing inequities.

4. **Personal Relevance** (optional):
   - Centers on the user's subjective experience and personal stakes.
   - When provided, its weight amplifies the total relevance of the issue.

### Weight Calculation
Each category receives a weight on a **1-10 scale**. These weights are assigned using the following logic:

1. **Empirical Data**: Factors such as statistical relevance and proportional population impact are prioritized.
2. **Relative Significance**: Issues central to public discourse or policy are weighted higher.
3. **User Inputs**: When "Personal Relevance" is present, its weight increases the total relevance via a modifier:
   ```javascript
   relevanceModifier = 1 + category.weight / 10;
   ```

Note that AI is responsible for calculating weights as they are subjective based on the facts returned, so the exact weight calculation algorithm is not transparent.

## 3. **How AI Drives the Reasoning**

The reasoning behind the weights is powered by OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o model. AI generates the following structured output for each category:

- **Weight**: Numeric score (1-10) reflecting the category's importance.
- **Facts**: Five key data points, supported by verified sources.
- **Reasoning**: An explanation connecting facts to the weight.

The AI ensures reasoning aligns with user-specified perspectives, year, and relevance preferences. Facts are further enhanced by verifying real-world sources via external APIs.

## 4. **The Role of Inputs in Shaping the Analysis**

User inputs are pivotal to tailoring the analysis:

1. **Topic**: Defines the scope of analysis.
2. **Personal Impact**: Amplifies the total relevance of "Personal Relevance."
3. **Bias Preference**: Adjusts analysis to align with user preferences (e.g., left, right, or neutral).
4. **Year**: Filters reasoning and data to match the chosen timeframe.
5. **Days Per Year**: Scales the "total hours" output based on user availability.

---

## 5. **The Total Hours Metric**

The "total hours" recommendation reflects actionable time investment. It is calculated as:

```javascript
const totalHours = Math.round((averageWeight / 10) * (totalAvailableHours / 5) * relevanceModifier);
```

For example (pseudocode):

```
statisticalImpact = 5
policyImpact = 4
socialRelevance = 6
personalRelevance = 8
totalAvailableHours = 240 

totalWeight = 5 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 23
averageWeight = 23/10 = 2.3
relevanceModifier = 1.8 (based on personal relevance of 1.8)

round((2.3 / 10) * (240 / 5) * 1.8) = 20 total hours
```

The maximum hours per year for a given topic is `totalAvailableHours / 5 * relevanceModifier`, so a topic that may not be highly weighted by traditional analysis will get a higher recommendation if it's highly personally meaningful.

### Key Features:
- **Scalability**: Adjusts for total available hours (days per year * 24).
- **Relevance Amplification**: Increases when "Personal Relevance" is included.
- **Actionable Description**: Explains how hours were derived, ensuring transparency.

## 6. **Notes on References**

Sources ensure the credibility of facts and reasoning. However, links generated by AI are often hallucinatory, as AI datasets are decoupled from the sources they are generated from.

To work around this issue, iffy.app generates references as follows:

1. AI analysis is performed, which returns 5 facts for each category
2. A Google search is performed for each fact, and 3 results per fact are added as references

These aren't "sources" per se; rather they are pointers toward getting a user started with additional research.

An additional pointer is provided to [Ground News](https://ground.news) for each source so users can check a reference for bias.

## 7. **Why This Methodology Matters**

In a landscape dominated by information overload, this tool offers a structured approach to prioritization. It balances:

- **Rationality**: Grounding decisions in evidence and logic.
- **Personalization**: Adapting analysis to individual perspectives and constraints.

By demystifying complex topics and offering actionable insights, the tool empowers users to engage with political issues more meaningfully and effectively.
